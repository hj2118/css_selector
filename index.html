        <p class>Responsible breeders do not sell their puppies to pet stores because they want to meet their puppy buyers in person and a majority of national breed clubs' Codes of Ethics prohibit or discourage their members from selling their dogs to pet stores. The suppliers of pet store puppites are largely "puppy mills," commercial facilities that mass-produce puppies for sale.</p>
        <p class>Pet stores often do not disclose the origin of the puppies they sell.Most pet stores do not disclose the true origins of their puppies.</p>
        <p class>Puppies in puppy mills are suddenly taken away from their mother, instead of a gradual weaning process. This separation is stressful in itself, may affect the puppyâ€™s ability to cope with other stresses, and also removes the puppy from an environment in which a lot of early learning takes place.</p>
